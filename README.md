# Proj-Kryptos
The true, privacy-focused web browser.

Proj Kryptos is designed for privacy.
There is no reason for a web browser to ping any external server besides for updates.

The only connection Kryptos will make is to GitHub for updates if the user wishes.

# Updates
During installation, you will have the choice to download the update module.
If you choose to download the updated modual:
Auto updates will be turned off by default, so the user would need to go into settings to check for updates.
If auto update is enabled then Kryptos will check for a new version 2 times a week.

If the user does not install the update model, the user will need to download any updates from Git Hub manually.
Kryptos will make a config file with your configs saved to it as well as an encrypted file for passwords and payment methods if the user saved them.
When manually updating Kryptos ensure you select the update option in the installer or Kryptos will overwrite your config files.

More updates to come.
